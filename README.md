# Next Word Prediction using LSTM

A Jupyter Notebook-based project for Natural Language Processing (NLP) that generates text using an LSTM-based neural network.

## Overview

This project uses TensorFlow and Keras to build a text generation model. The model is trained on the text and can generate new text based on an input seed text.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Python (>= 3.6)
- TensorFlow
- Numpy

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/shaadclt/Next-Word-Prediction-LSTM.git
```

2. Download the Sherlock Holmes text data and place it in the root folder with the name `sherlock-holm.es_stories_plain-text_advs.txt`.

3. Install the required Python packages:

```shell
pip install tensorflow numpy
```

## Executing the Project

Open the Jupyter Notebook `next_word_prediction.ipynb` and run all steps.


## Project Structure

The project directory structure is as follows:

```
- nwp_model.h5             # The trained NLP model
- sherlock-holm.es_stories_plain-text_advs.txt   # Sherlock Holmes text data
- next_word_prediction.ipynb        # Jupyter Notebook 
- README.md                # This README file
```
